-- World PvP's part of /sd testdata (Dev/TestData.lua, TestData.Register):
-- the made-up route's two fight marks, so Your Diary's plates have a fight
-- on them. Development tooling: listed in the TOC's do-not-package block,
-- and left out by .pkgmeta.
--
-- Marks only, as the route keeps them (Journey.Fight, the core's: kind
-- "fight" on j.marks); no fight rows on anyone, as before the move. They
-- are the only marks the script writes, so writing them at "route", after
-- the route, leaves j.marks in the order it had.
