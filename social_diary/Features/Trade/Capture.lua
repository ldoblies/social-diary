-- Trade capture (INT-1, Must; verified in Session 1 as T-E8): a completed
-- trade, written as a row of its kind (Kind.lua) on the person traded with.
--
-- The first interaction source, and the best one to build first: it is
-- self-contained, it was verified end to end in this client, and it is the
-- spine of flow 2 -- trade with a stranger, walk away, add them an hour later
-- and find the trade already on their profile.
--
-- The awkward part is that the trade window's contents are gone by the time
-- the trade is confirmed, so the snapshot is rebuilt on every change while
-- the window is open and only committed when the client says the trade
-- completed. Session 1 observed that confirmation as UI_INFO_MESSAGE 251 and
-- the cancellation as 250.
--
-- Rebuilding on every change has a trap: completing the trade empties the
-- slots, and those change events can land before the confirmation, so the
-- last reading is an empty window (seen in the client, 6 Oct: a completed
-- trade stored with an empty context). So the contents are also fixed the
-- moment either side accepts -- any later change resets the acceptance and
-- with it that copy -- and nothing is read after the window closes.
--
-- LOC-1: the outcome is read from the numeric message id, never from the
-- English text ("Trade complete."), which would break in any other locale.
